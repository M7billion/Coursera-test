  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><section id="section1"><h2 id="h1">Quasars</h2> A quasar is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus, powered by a supermassive black hole, with mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc.</section></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><section id="section2"><h2 id="h2">Black Holes</h2>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</section></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><section id="section3"><h2 id="h3">Neutron Stars</h2> A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich. Except for black holes and some hypothetical objects, neutron stars are the smallest and densest currently known class of stellar objects.</section></div>
